Message Recording Bot

Python 3.8.3 Discord Bot For Discord Moderators Record messages before/after they are edited or deleted by users. Requires a settings.json file in the same directory, see example for how to set this up. It's pretty straight forward and simple. For setting the bot channel you must do it by channel ID but excluded channels and excluded users there's no need for ID just do the channel name or user name as such

The master branch is completed and tested to be fully functional. If you are running this bot ensureyou have given it the proper permissions for discord so it can write in it's bot channel and view all the other channels it is monitoring. If you have any issues or sugestions please leave them here on github and I'll get around to fixing them asap.
