Message Recording Bot

Python 3.8.3 Discord Bot For Discord Moderators Record messages before/after they are edited or deleted by users. Requires a settings.json file in the same directory, see example for how to set this up. It's pretty straight forward and simple. For setting the bot channel you must do it by channel ID but excluded channels and excluded users there's no need for ID just do the channel name or user name as such

Need to do some more testing on this latest commit as I've cleaned the code up significantly so I just need to do a few quick tests to ensure it's working properly. The previous commit that has been standing for a long time is functional, but is poorly written code and the logging system is abysmal.
