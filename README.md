Message Recording Bot

Python 3.8.3 Discord Bot For Discord Moderators Record messages before/after they are edited or deleted by users. Requires a settings.json file in the same directory, see example for how to set this up. If enabled in settings.json it will create a folder in the directory it is ran to use as an output for its logging. It will log what it has done, but doesn't store it's cache. This logging system is extremely similar to how the game Elite Dangerous does journal files.

This isn't complete yet, but it will be here soon(few days).
